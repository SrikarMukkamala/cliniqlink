List Question Average F1 Score: 0.83
Metric error: "hypothesis" expects pre-tokenized hypothesis (Iterable[str]): The twelve thoracic vertebrae are characterized by their articulated ribs, a heart-shaped vertebral body, long spinous process, broad and overlapping laminae, flat superior articular processes, and club-shaped transverse processes that project posterolaterally.
Metric error: "hypothesis" expects pre-tokenized hypothesis (Iterable[str]): The two demifacets on a typical thoracic vertebra's body articulate with the head of its own rib and the head of the rib below.
Metric error: "hypothesis" expects pre-tokenized hypothesis (Iterable[str]): The pelvic outlet is the lower part of the pelvic cavity below the pelvic inlet. It is bounded by the levator ani muscles anteriorly, the pelvic floor posteriorly, the ischium laterally, and the sacrotuberous ligament and coccygeus muscles medially.
Metric error: "hypothesis" expects pre-tokenized hypothesis (Iterable[str]): The lumbar spinal nerves originate from the lumbar and sacral plexuses and enter the lower limb carrying fibers from spinal cord levels L1 to S3.
Metric error: "hypothesis" expects pre-tokenized hypothesis (Iterable[str]): Osteoporosis is a pathophysiological condition in which bone quality is normal but the quantity of bone is deficient.
Average Short Answer F1 Score: 0.41
Metric error: "hypothesis" expects pre-tokenized hypothesis (Iterable[str]): The median nerve provides innervation to the lumbrical muscles responsible for movements related to both the index finger and the middle finger.
Metric error: "hypothesis" expects pre-tokenized hypothesis (Iterable[str]): The transverse processes of adjacent sacral vertebrae fuse lateral to the position of the intervertebral foramina and lateral to the bifurcation of spinal nerves into posterior and anterior rami.
Metric error: "hypothesis" expects pre-tokenized hypothesis (Iterable[str]): The spinal accessory nerve (XI) and the vertebral artery can pass through both the foramina transversaria along the sides of the cervical spine and within structures associated closely with the atlas (Cl) vertebra.
Metric error: "hypothesis" expects pre-tokenized hypothesis (Iterable[str]): The rotation of the head relates to the contraction of individual spinotransversalis muscles.
Metric error: "hypothesis" expects pre-tokenized hypothesis (Iterable[str]): The junction of the sagittal and lambdoid sutures is the lambda.
Average Multi-hop F1 Score: 0.56
Short Inverse Response: Incorrect Explanation: The number of vertebrae varies depending on the body region with which they are associated. There are seven cervical, twelve thoracic, five lumbar, five sacral, and three to four coccygeal vertebrae.

Short Inverse Response: Incorrect Explanation: The highest thoracic dermatome on the posterior back is primarily T2.
Metric error: "hypothesis" expects pre-tokenized hypothesis (Iterable[str]): Incorrect Explanation: The highest thoracic dermatome on the posterior back is primarily T2.
Short Inverse Response: Incorrect Explanation: Lumbar vertebrae are actually much larger than any other vertebrae in any other region.
Metric error: "hypothesis" expects pre-tokenized hypothesis (Iterable[str]): Incorrect Explanation: Lumbar vertebrae are actually much larger than any other vertebrae in any other region.
Short Inverse Response: Incorrect Explanation: The testicular artery does not pass through both the deep and superficial inguinal rings. Instead, the testicular artery passes through the deep inguinal ring and emerges into the superficial inguinal ring.

Instead, the testicular artery passes through the deep inguinal ring and emerges into the superficial inguinal ring.
Short Inverse Response: Incorrect Explanation: The urethra penetrates the levator ani muscle horizontally, not vertically.
